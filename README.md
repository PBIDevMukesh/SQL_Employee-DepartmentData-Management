# SQL_Employee-DepartmentData-Management

This project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques for managing and querying employee and department data. The dataset includes information about employees, 
their job titles, salaries, hire dates, commission, and department details. Key functionalities include retrieving specific employee records,
performing self-joins to relate employees with their managers, handling subqueries, and using various join types (e.g., inner join, outer join, self join). 

The project showcases the some of the following tasks:

1)Displaying employees earning more than specific amounts in certain departments.
2)Identifying managers in specific departments.
3)Finding employees who joined before their managers.
4)Listing employees with salaries greater than their managers.
5)Fetching records of employees earning the same as a particular employee.
6)Performing aggregate functions like calculating maximum, minimum, and average salaries.
7)Displaying departmental information, including handling departments with no employees.
8)Using self-joins to relate employees to their managers and other advanced queries.
