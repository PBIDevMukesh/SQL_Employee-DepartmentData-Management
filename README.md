# SQL_Employee-DepartmentData-Management

This project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques for managing and querying employee and department data. The dataset includes information about employees, 
their job titles, salaries, hire dates, commission, and department details. Key functionalities include retrieving specific employee records,
performing self-joins to relate employees with their managers, handling subqueries, and using various join types (e.g., inner join, outer join, self join).
